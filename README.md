python-math
===========

A python program which solves mainly geometry problems. 

This program is written for python3, therefore running it on any version of python lower than 3 will produce errors at some point.
Once you have installed python3 all you need to do it run the 'math.py' file. You can do this in terminal by simply typing: `python3 math.py' in the python-math directory.
